Ray marching dramatically lowers the number of steps by allowing us to define a maximum safe distance we can step a ray forward. We do this by defining every single object in a 3d scene not by a series of planes or trianges but instead by the minimum distance from any point in space to the surface of the object."}),`

Interpolate between edges of objects. And create many instances of the same object without taxing computation."}),`

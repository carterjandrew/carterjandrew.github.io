# Porto

Porto took my solo traveling virginity. As such it was both a big, rather entertaining, learning expirience and absolute delight.

## Homelessness

My first ever stay in a hostel ended up not realling having me stay there. Let me lay the scene:

I flew out in the evening to Munich, having a 10 hour layover during the day there, and then flew into Porto that night. Being unable to sleep on planes means I spent the last 39 hours awake. I landed in Porto at 22:00 and already dreaming of the probably uncomfy bed at my hostel. Little did I know, that despite booking and paying for my reservation, the hostel had never registerd I was meant to be there. 

Showing up at the front, I had 20 minuted until the midnight checkin deadline ended, and was very confused by the lack of a front desk, or a unlocked door, or any correspondance from the hostel. Finally, I decided to call them and after 3 attempts got hold of someone working a front desk remotely. I asked them about my reservation and confirmed they had never seen my booking. Then halfway through reading out my booking number ran out of minutes to talk. Apparently the phone pass I got only gave me a few free minutes of calling. 

Fortunately, after a while, someone staying in the hostel opened the door for me and I explained my situation. They gracefully let me in and, without knowing if there really was a free bed for me to sleep in, let me crash in one of the bunks inside. I was promply kicked out by the cleaning staff in the morning.

Day 2 had as rich a learning expirience as my first night. After getting kicked out I made my way to the Miragia area of the city. My next hostel, [Onefam Ribiera](https://www.hostelworld.com/pwa/hosteldetails.php/Onefam-Ribeira/Porto/299858?from=2025-06-15&to=2025-06-16&guests=2) was my faviourite hostel I stayed in by far.

Upon ariving, I was greeted warmly by the staff, and quickly started meeting other people in the hostel. It's located in a incredibly ideal location inside a beautiful historical apartment in the center of the Miragia area. 

Usually, a complimentary dinner is offered each night at the hostel. Instead, tonight there was complimentary sangria, with fresh cut orange slices in it. Naturally I took advantage of this. And then advantage of the cheap bottles of wine at the front desk. And then the cheap glasses of wine at the bar. I have never in my life been this drunk before. And honestly, I hope I never am again. The next morning I found myself unable to keep even water down until about 15:00. My body thouroughly taught me a lession on my tolerance for alcahol.

## Tourist Things

The next day I stayed busy to make sure I made up for the missed time.

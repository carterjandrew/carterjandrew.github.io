# Offroute Tracking

During my internship I was excited to participate in OnX Map's monthly *Day of Innovation* hackathon. Where workers get to spend some time on the clock working on features they want to see in the application. I was excited to add ***a feature I was very suprised wasn't in the application allready***

# Feature Definition

I set out to develop an option for users to select any track in their application and then recive notifications if they are off that route.


# Feature Defense/Market Research

There are three reasons I could see this being useful:

## Safety

If you are hiking in low visibility conditions and rushing (say your trying to escape a storm on a mountain); it's suprisingly easy to get lost or follow the wrong route. Using a feature like this can prevent you from getting lost. 

It also definitely help with anxiety for the more timid explorers.

## Engagement

When you are out in nature the goal is to be out in nature. You don't want to be checking your phone repeatedly to make sure your on the trail you wanted to follow. This feature let's users comfortably hit the power button and engage with their surroundings more completely. If you don't get a notification, trust all is going well.

## Competition

A lot of OnX's compeitiors already do this in their applications. When a user is trying to decide which option to go with seeing that feature checked can be a deciding factor between choosing us over a competitor. Even if they never plan on using it.
